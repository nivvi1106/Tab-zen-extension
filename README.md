##  Core Features

* **Integrated Pomodoro Timer:** A simple and intuitive timer system to manage your productivity, built directly into the main screen.
    * **Dual Timer Display:** Clearly shows the time remaining for both the current **Focus** and upcoming **Break** sessions.
    * **Auto-Cycling:** Automatically transitions between focus and break sessions to keep you in a productive rhythm.

* **On-Screen Customization:** Control your sessions directly from the main timer view:
    * Set custom durations for your **Focus Time** and **Break Time**.
    * Define the **Number of Cycles** before the timer completes its run.

* **Smart Site Blocking:** Two powerful modes to eliminate distractions during focus sessions:
    * **Blacklist Mode:** Block a persistent list of user-defined distracting sites or URL keywords.
    * **Whitelist Mode:** Allow access *only* to a specific list of user-defined sites, blocking everything else.

* **Strict Mode:** For deep work, enable Strict Mode to prevent pausing the timer or changing any settings after a focus session has started.

* **Productivity Dashboard:** A dedicated **Stats** page to visualize your progress with simple charts for "Total Focus Hours" and "Focus Minutes This Week."

    * A clean, minimal, and calming user interface.
